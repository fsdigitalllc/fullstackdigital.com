        title: "Focal Dystonia is a neurological condition which affects a muscle or group of muscles, causing involuntary muscular contractions and abnormal postures. As the 3rd most common neurological condition in the world, there is currently no medicinal cure for the hundreds of thousands of people affected by its symptoms. Dr. Joaquin Farias, a leading specialist treating dystonia using movement therapy, approached the Fullstack team with the challenge of creating a complete online dystonia recovery program. Our team was particularly excited about this project, as this would provide dystonia patients across the world with complete recovery, for the first time ever."

          Dr. Farias’ revolutionary thinking behind the concepts of Dystonias and Focal Dystonia Treatment yielded success with over 2,000 patients worldwide. But with over 200,000 conditions in the US alone, he reached a crossroads: how could one person make a worldwide impact for Focal Dystonia sufferers? The answer would be surprisingly simple, yet difficult to accomplish: create an online subscription platform where patients across the globe could have easy access to the necessary tools to reach a full recovery, without losing the personal feel.

          We started with the information architecture of the platform. To ensure patients could navigate each program in a structured manner, we created a flexible hierarchy specifically designed to facilitate the long-term healing process. Because we were using video, it was inspired by the leading video streaming option today: Netflix. The result was then adjusted based on Dr. Farias’ unique experiences with thousands of patients worldwide,  as it has been proven to show results.

          Like any rehab program, Dr. Farias’ platform needed to be 100% focused on content & recovery. Our mission during the UX design process was to ensure that patients spend the least amount of time figuring out where things like notifications and videos can be found. The recovery process should feel familiar as possible, almost as if they were visiting Dr. Farias himself.
