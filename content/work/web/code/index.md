        title: "The {code} team, first launched as the open source division of EMC, began branding work with Fullstack in 2016 when EMC & Dell Computers agreed to merge as the newly formed DellEMC. Starting in 2018, {code} rebranded once again, to encompass all open source under Dell Technologies. The {code} initiative had reached success as future Dell Technologies customers interacted through the {code} community and its platforms. As an open source division, it's flagship website was put together over time, as one off projects. With 2017's rebrand, the website needed to be redesigned and rebuilt as one cohesive property."
