Many organizations and prospects in the high performance data storage industry recognize DDN Storage as the leader, but it was not clear why. We worked with the DDN team to create an integrated marketing campaign designed to connect with prospects online and in person, with a focus on positioning DDN Storage as the leader in 4 distinct categories."

          <p>The purpose of the campaign was clear: to not only educate existing customers and strengthen the perception of DDN as the leader in HPC Storage, but also help inform and create further market awareness among prospects and those new to DDN.</p>

          <p>We used this premise to inspire the name of the campaign: “Did You Know?” With a simple question, we would arouse curiosity and draw attention to the company. Behind it would be a list of carefully organized facts about DDN. Since DDN is in a highly specialized and technical market niche, we needed to ensure these facts were both engaging and compelling.</p>

          With the theme of the campaign set, we looked to our research to guide us in what prospects cared about most when choosing data storage infrastructure vendors. We then worked as a team to categorize these needs and turn them into impactful facts that correlated with compelling value propositions.

          What good would it be to create all these assets and then not connect them? The campaign message had to be simple in order to be compelling enough for booth traffic to engage with DDN amid so much other ‘noise’ at a such a large conference. It also needed to be believable given that many of DDN’s prospects and customers are PhD’s, technology buffs, and turned off by gratuitous advertising. The campaign succeeded in combining relevant conference information, as well as appropriate and useful giveaways that netted in a positive experience as visitors explored the future of HPC with DDN.
