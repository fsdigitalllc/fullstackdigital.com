        title: "The {code} team, first launched as the open source division of EMC, began branding work with Fullstack in 2016 when EMC & Dell Computers agreed to merge as the newly formed DellEMC. The {code} initiative had reached success as future DellEMC customers interacted through the {code} community and its platforms. Starting in 2018, {code} was moving to encompass all of open source under Dell Technologies. The {code} team and Fullstack came together to create a cohesive brand platform to support the transition, but more importantly solidify the {code} team as a leader in the open source community and setup the brand for the open future ahead."
